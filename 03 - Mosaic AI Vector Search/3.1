Create Self-managed Vector Search Index
In the previous demo, we chunked the raw PDF document pages into small sections, computed the embeddings, and saved it as a Delta Lake table. Our dataset is now ready.

Next, we'll configure Databricks Vector Search to ingest data from this table.

Vector search index uses a Vector search endpoint to serve the embeddings (you can think about it as your Vector Search API endpoint).
Multiple Indexes can use the same endpoint. Let's start by creating one.

Learning Objectives:

By the end of this demo, you will be able to;

Set up an endpoint for Vector Search.

Store the embeddings and their metadata using the Vector Search.

Inspect the Vector Search endpoint and index using the UI.

Retrieve documents from the vector store using similarity search.
