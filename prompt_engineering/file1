In-Context Learning with AI Playground
In this demo, we will show the importance of providing context when using generative AI models. First, we will prompt the model to provide a response to a query that you know it has no knowledge of, e.g. proprietary information request, personal information request, obscure knowledge request. Then we will review the response for hallucinations, incorrect information, or lack of detail. In order to overcome this problem, we will provide the prompt a document or reference that contains the correct information as supplemental information and ask the query again. Finally, we will review the new response for a change in detail given the new information as prompt context.

Learning Objectives:

By the end of this demo, you will be able to;

Identify scenarios where generative AI models may produce hallucinations in response to prompts.

Apply techniques to construct prompts that guide generative AI models to provide responses without hallucinations.

Augment prompts with additional context to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses generated by generative AI models.
