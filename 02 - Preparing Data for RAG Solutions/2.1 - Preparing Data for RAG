Preparing Data for RAG
In this demo, we will focus on ingesting PDF documents as a source for our retrieval process. First, we will ingest the PDF files and process them using self-managed vector search embeddings.

Learning Objectives:

By the end of this demo, you will be able to:

Split the data into chunks that are at least as small as the maximum context window of the LLM to be used later.

Describe how to appropriately choose an embedding model.

Compute embeddings for each of the chunks using a Databricks-managed embedding model.

Use the chunking strategy to divide up the context information to be provided to a model.
